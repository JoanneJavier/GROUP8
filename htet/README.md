# The Drive for Electric Cars

## Project Overview

#### **Null Hypothesis**: Increase in gas price does not affect people's interest in electric cars. 
#### In this project, we compared the trend in weekly gas prices in California against the trend for interest in electric cars.
#### Data from google trends for keywords 'Tesla', 'Hybrid' and 'Electric Car' is used to measure public interest.
#### Weekly gas price data is obtained from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration website](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_y05sf_dpg&f=w)
